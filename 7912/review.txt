Thank you for the warning of the risk of overbuilt.
That is the reason why I am giving myself a week to finish this Notion (until the 15th January) and feel 
satisfied (just feel like it's good enough not perfect!!). And off course leave it room to be slightly
improved on the long run.
And for the rest of the month, I'll try to slowly implement routine after routine but really slowly since it 
takes 59days to develop a habit. And there is the risk of feeling overwhelmed.

I have started to implement those routines in my life and I think I can keep up.
Today I have succeeded in the exam rank 02 when everyone around me didn't believe in me (except my good friends).
I did it in 2 tries (the first was without any revision just to do it again after so long). Everyone told me 
to keep trying over and over again the exam, while I wanted to reallyyy study and go there fully prepared 
and to not just wait for a easy run. (i studied EVERYTHING and in a week where I had a lot going on).

I have improved my self esteem and trust by so much. I took me hard work and a lot of duaas al-hamdoulilah.
And over those almost 2 years I have grinded and worked really hard (turning down hangout or playing with friends)
and honestly by implementing this I genuinely think it'll leave me so much free time.
This is the daily structure I want:

From Subh to Duhur (Career + Belongings)
- Work on my career + 42

Duhur to Asr (Myself and hobbies)
- Work on my abilities and hobbies
+  Document my distractions
- Increase my knowledge
- Hang out with relatives and friends

Asr and Magrib (Islam)
- Work on my Islamic knowledge and overall improve as a Muslim
- Be a better servant of Allah
- Body care and workout

Magrib to Isha (Self-improvement)
- Work my self and improve
- Rest and relax too

Isha
Sleeeeeppp~

=> I used to do todolist and work all day on 42 and this 7912 project or other tasks.
honestly I am really excited and confident i'm finally going downhill. I know I tackled the most annoying part and I know
and trust that I do really good when I have structure and organization just like for the exam.

I agree that my Notion is perhaps overloaded that is why I want to make it more simple and that gives me over a week to do so.

So I'm going to go through those pages a last time and either delete what I don't really need or ask for advises on those to you.
I'm curious, what do you think (in a short answer please) ?
